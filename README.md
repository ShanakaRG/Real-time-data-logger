# Real-time-data-logger

serial_realtime_plot.py code allows to read serial port of the laptop (here it is COM5) and plot the data coming from serial port. In this particular code, serial data sent by using an Arduino board.

final code.py is used to read MPU6050 acceleration data from the serial port and then save them in to a excel and csv files. Additionally, we convert time domain signal to frequency domain and all the signal data were saved and also plot.
